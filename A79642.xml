            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Prayer to be said at the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of an Army, or before they March.</head>
            <p>GLorious Lord God of Hosts, in whose strength the Israelites marcht of old, and prevailed against their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; thou who wast then pleased to go before thy People, as their guide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them also (when need was) to be their defender; hear us, we beseech thee, and be present with us, who, in the humility of our minds, and sincerity of our hearts, do now call upon thee, for thy protection. It is not our own Arm, O Lord, nor any Child of man that we trust to; thou thy self hast told us, that there is no help in them. All our desires are wholly to thee: We go not out, but in thy Name; we do not arm our selves, but in thy Fear; nor shall we ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, but by thy Power. The race is not to the swift, nor the battell to the strong: to thee alone belong the issues of War, nor shall we hope for any successe from any other; For whom have we in heaven, but thee? and there is none upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119812:5"/>earth that we desire, in comparison of thee. O be thou our guide then, and our defence, our God, our Shield, and our strong Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So shall five of us chace an hundred, and an hundred of us shall put ten thousand to flight. Our Enemies shall come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us one way, but they shall flie before us seven waies; and thou, even thou alone, shall be glorified in their confusion. To this end, regard, O Lord, not the cry of our sins, that presse thee hourly for more vengeance, but the justice of our cause, that pleads strongly for some favour. It is not Ambition, or Malice, that hath thrust us into this posture, but the necessary defence of thy Church, thy Truth, our Laws, our Liberties, and the Obedience which we owe, under thee, unto thine Anoynted. O let us ever remember what thou hast so strictly commanded, that when we go forth with the host, against the Enemy, we should then (as at all other times, but then especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) keep our selves from every wicked thing. Teach us, good God, and assist us by thy Spirit, that as we carry our lives in our hands, so we may also have thy fear in our hearts, thy praise in our mouths, thy great goodnesse in remembrance, and thy grace to lead us in all our waies. Let us fear thee, as we ought, and none but thee, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119812:6"/>so we may not fear what man can do unto us. Put away far from us, as all presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and vain boasting, so all faintnesse of spirit: Let us not thus turn either to the right hand, or to the left: Onely let us be strong, but in thee; and of a good courage, but onely in hope of thy Salvation. Make our Battels wholly thine, that they may end in Victory; and in thy good time crown all our Victories with an honourable and a Christian Peace. In the mean time preserve us, as from danger, so from want. Sustain us by thy Power, and supply us by thy Goodnesse. Continue and confirm unto us the blessing of health; Make us all of one mind, and of one heart, and drive away that evill spirit of Division far from us. As oft as we arm this outward, let us not forget the inward man. Let him also put on the Breast-plate of Righteousnesse, the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is, the Word of God. As oft as we move, and march, let us fix our eye, the eye of Faith, as they of old, on the Land of Promise; so we, on that heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the new <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which is the mother of us all. And because there is no way thither, but thorow the red Sea of our Saviours Blood, open us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, that passage, and let all those
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119812:6"/>spirituall Aegyptians, our Sins, find there an eternall grave, where we hope for everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Salvation: that after all the toylsome motions of this mortall life, when we have finished our warfare upon earth, fought a good fight, and kept the faith, we may at length be admitted unto that blessed vision of everlasting Peace, in the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of thee our God: and that for Jesus Christ his sake, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, three Persons, but one eternall and onely wise God, be ascribed all Honour and Glory, Might, Majesty and Dominion from this time forth, and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

In the dead silence and shadow of the night, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the horrour of that everlasting Darknesse, where is nothing but weeping and gnashing of teeth. Gracious God, raise up in us, and sanctifie to us, these wholsome Meditations, and grant us Grace so to think of those things, that we may never feel them. To this end, let thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be towards us, in the day time, and in the night season, let us sing of thee, and make our Prayer unto thee, who art the God of our life. But since we have it from thine owne mouth, That except thou keep the City, the Watchman waketh but in vain; guard us, we beseech thee, and this place, O thou who art the great keeper of Israel. Thou that doest neither slumber nor sleep, Watch with us, and Watch over us; Save and defend us from the hands of

            <p>O Lord God, which didst of late wound us for our sins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume us for our transgression, by the sharp sword of a prevailing enemy, who slew and subdued our dear brethren with a rage, which reached up to heaven; and even now purposed to assault us and keep us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as Bond-men, and Bond-women unto them; we blesse and praise thy glorious name, O Lord, that in the midst of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou hast remembred mercy, and comforted us after the time thou hadst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted us, by giving us this Victory over our enemies; scattering, and destroying them who threatned destruction to us; O God, mighty in battle, it was thy right hand and holy arm which wrought this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work for us; therefore unto thy father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodnesse, we offer our selves, our souls, and bodies, which thou hast delivered from fear, and exalted with comfort, to be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sacrifice unto thee, and will alwaies praise &amp; magnifie thee for these thy mercies in the midst of the Congregation, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
